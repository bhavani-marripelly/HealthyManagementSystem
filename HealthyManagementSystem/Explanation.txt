The project begins by identifying the need to analyze fitness data in a simple and effective
 way to help individuals understand their health condition. A structured fitness dataset 
containing attributes such as age, height, weight, calorie intake, and exercise duration 
is used for overall analysis, while real-time user input is collected to provide personalized 
results. Python is chosen as the development platform due to its simplicity and strong support 
for data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, 
NumPy, and Matplotlib.

After collecting the data, the system calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the user’s 
height and weight. Based on the BMI value, a rule-based logic is applied to determine the 
recommended level of daily exercise. To make the analysis meaningful and visually interpretable,
 various data visualization techniques are implemented. Bar charts are used for comparison, pie
 charts for composition analysis, line charts for activity trends, histograms for distribution,
 and scatter plots to study relationships within the dataset.

Finally, the project presents the exercise recommendation using a human-friendly visual format
 that clearly indicates the suggested activity level. This combination of dataset analysis,
 personalized input, and graphical representation helps users easily understand their fitness
 status and required exercise intensity. The project demonstrates the practical application
 of Python in health analytics and highlights how data visualization can support better
 fitness-related decision-making.
